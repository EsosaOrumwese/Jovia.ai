I am Esosa Orumwese
Sometimes I'm small, sometimes I'm big
Batman seems to me as an interesting hero who beats all odds
I'm rewatching Young Justice and I'm interested in Zatanna's powers
She's a magician who's magic spells are cast by her speaking backwards.
She could say: "Burn, Freeze and Twist yourself" and it'll happen as far as she says it backwards
